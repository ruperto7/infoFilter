# infoFilter
initial research on a tool that saves personal time and increase personal Web-related productivity 

#Overview
Proposed outcome: The result could be a web page that contains ONLY what the user "needs" to see. (saving the trouble from inofmration overload)
Assumptions: Personal productivity on the web can be enhanced by using "filtering tools" that are preset by user.  

#Invitation
Every one is invited to share any thoughts. 

Thank you!
